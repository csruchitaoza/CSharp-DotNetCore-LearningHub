### Covariance and Contravariance
Dive into the concepts of covariance and contravariance, crucial aspects of C# type system. Gain a deep understanding of how these features contribute to more flexible and expressive code.

### Extension Methods
Dive into the concepts of Extension Methods, very useful feature provided in C# 3.0. Gain a deep understanding of how this feature makes it possible to add new methods to sealed classes, structures and bulit-in .Net classes and strutures .

Enjoy this exploration of advanced topics, and let's continue to expand your C# expertise!
